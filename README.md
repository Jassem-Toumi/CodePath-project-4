# Web Development Project 4 - *BestBook*

Submitted by: **Jassem Toumi**

This web app: **This code is a React application that fetches data from the New York Times Books API and displays information about books based on the selected category. It contains a search filter component that enables the user to filter books by category.

The app uses useState hooks to manage state for the categories, current category, books, and various book properties such as title, author, publisher, and description. It also uses useEffect hooks to handle side effects such as fetching data from the API and updating the component when state changes.

The app also includes functionality to slide the intro and main sections, select books, and move between books using a "Next" and "Back" button. It also includes the ability to ban certain properties such as authors, publishers, or current rank.**

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## Required Features

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**

- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
